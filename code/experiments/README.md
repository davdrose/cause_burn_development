## Experiment 1

- `caused vs lexical`
	- adults ([pre-registration](https://osf.io/wfg3p)) 
	- childern ([pre-registration](https://osf.io/e2buz)) 
- `made vs lexical`
	- adults ([pre-registration](https://osf.io/achv6)) 
	- childern ([pre-registration](https://osf.io/ph5tr)) 

In this experiment, adults and children who were between the ages of 4 - 9, were given two situations involving a causal chain. In one, Andy hits Suzy with his bike, she falls into the fence and the fence breaks. In the other, Sophia scared Bobby, he feel into a mirror and the mirror cracked. There were two differnt versions that varied the quetsions asked. In one, the caused vs lexcial condition, participants were asked e.g., "Who caused the fence to break?" and "Who broke the fence?". In the made vs lexical condition the same questions were asked but "made" was used instead of "caused".

The adult version was implemented in [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/).

The version for children was implemented in [Lookit](https://childrenhelpingscience.com/). To view the experiments in [Lookit](https://childrenhelpingscience.com/), first create a dummy experiment, then click on "Edit Study Design" in the right-hand column. Next, go to "Protocol Configuration" and paste the JSON file for the experiment that you want to view. Click "Save Changes" at the bottom. Once redirected to the study's main page, click "Preview Study."  *** Note: You must have a Lookit researcher account to do this.

## Experiment 2

- `caused vs lexical`
	- adults ([pre-registration](https://osf.io/f7k59)) 
	- childern (4- 6) ([pre-registration](https://osf.io/u3g8r)) and (7- 9) ([pre-registration](https://osf.io/3ha4k)) 
- `made vs lexical`
	- adults and children ([pre-registration](https://osf.io/ybsc5)) 

In this experiment, adults and children who were between the ages of 4 - 9, were given two sceanrios. In one, Suzy went to the beach, forgot her suncreen and got a sunburn. In the other, Andy took the latch off his basement window to fix it, it began raining, and his basement flooded. There were two differnt versions that varied the quetsions asked. In one, the caused vs lexcial condition, participants were asked e.g., "What caused Suzy's skin to burn?" and "What burned Suzy's skin?". In the made vs lexical condition the same questions were asked but "made" was used instead of "caused".

## Experiment 3

- adults and children ([pre-registration](https://osf.io/29k5h)) 

This experiment had the same design as experiment 2. The difference is that participants were asked why the outcome occurred.
