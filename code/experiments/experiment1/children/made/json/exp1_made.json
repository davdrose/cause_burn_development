Though many researchers think they do, children may think they don’t.\n\n In this study,  when we ask “Who made the fence to break?”, we expect children to mention the distal character, but when we ask “What broke the fence?”, we expect them to say the proximal character. Likewise, when we ask “Who made the mirror to crack?”, we expect children to say the distal character. But when we ask “Who cracked the mirror?”, we expect them to say the proximal character but not the distal character.\n\n Although children’s answers can vary, there aren’t any “right” or “wrong” answers to the questions. We are just interested in looking at the average responses from children and we won’t take any specific answers as “good” or “bad”.\n\n If you are interested in learning more about this, please see the following experimental paper with adults <a href=https://philpapers.org/rec/ROSCAB-3 target='_blank' rel='noopener'>here</a>.
