3082,condition 1,"I think Suzy broke the fence for reasons captured by my last answer, although the use of these two questions in sequence is making me reconsider my last answer. I still think she's probably responsible with respect to both questions. Summarizing both answers, I could say that Andy's body broke the fence -- its collision with the fence was the proximate cause -- but that Suzy's behavior was more fundamentally the cause and that she is thus the person who basically broke it. ",Suzy,"I think Suzy probably can best be said to have broken the fence because Andy's falling into it was not a volitional act but the result of his being thrown into it by Suzy's chosen action. Suzy didn't knowingly break the fence, but she did choose the behavior that most directly led to that outcome. Andy chose to watch butterflies near the fence, but that choice did not have a negligent component in it that put the fence at risk. At most, one could argue that had Andy been paying more attention to his surroundings, he might have mustered a better reaction time and moved to evade Suzy's path. But I think just as pedestrians have the right of way and are not typically considered at fault when hit by drivers, so too Andy should not be considered at fault here, not least because he was (as best I recall the relevant image) standing still when Suzy ran into him, and thus not making it harder to avoid an accident in the way he might have been had he also been moving quickly.  ",Suzy,order_2,"I think Bobby caused the mirror to crack. Trying to micromanage Sophia's (or anyone's) startle reactions seems unreasonable. If she wants to practice minimizing her reactions in such cases, perhaps she can learn to be more still in a way that would protect future mirrors, but that is not a generally recognized social obligation.  Bobby is fundamentally at fault here, though he probably had no intention of breaking the mirror -- he deliberately provoked a shock that would have an unpredictable and likely somewhat intense reaction. ",Bobby,"I would say Sophia cracked the mirror. I recognize the inconsistency in saying that after the first scenario, but I think operating a vehicle is different from shouting boo, though there was a failure of foresight in both cases. And if someone has to pay for the broken mirror, I think it should be Bobby rather than Sophia. ",Sophia,
