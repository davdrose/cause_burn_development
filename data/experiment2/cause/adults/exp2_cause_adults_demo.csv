The scenario with involving fixing the window showed a man completing this task, while the scenario involving very obviously having forgotten something showed a woman. I feel that this is cementing of gender roles in a negative way, as the woman in these scenarios is portrayed as very obviously forgetful in a matter of fact sense, while there is more leeway to describe why the unfortunate scenario happened to the man. Perhaps this is the point of the study, but if not then you should consider adding more scenarios or reversing the gender roles to bring this study into the 21st century, in my opinion.
